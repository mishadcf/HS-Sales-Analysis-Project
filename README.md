HS Sales Analysis Project

I gathered data from Airbnb, Booking.com and our website to gather insight on our bookings. My father owns a hospitality startup, for which I run the online functions: website maintenance, marketing and data management.

The records needed to be cleaned, reformatted and gathered into a CSV.

For the data cleaning/ wrangling I used Pandas (and Excel to check). Then created a simple Tableau Dashboard with key metrics. 

I uploaded to Google Cloud in order to do further EDA with BigQuery
